# Assessing-congestion-patterns-and-flexibility-reactions

This repository elaborates on the code per section.

For traceability and clearness, the code was subdivided into several parts, and each parts resulted in certain data-files that are used in subsequent parts.

First the Powerfactory data extraction scripts and files are described, in file 1a up to and including e. This is code to extract components and congestion data within the customized Powerfactory grid network, and to appoint congestion contributors, as also described in Appendix A.1.

Secondly, scripting of the flexibility reaction model and calculation of ultimate percentages is elaborated on in file 2 'envelopes' in the first 6 steps as elaborated on in appendix A.3.

Thirdly, scripting of spatial correlation is also performed in file 2 'envelopes' from step 6 and onward, as elaborated on in appendix A.2.

Fourthly, n scripting file 2 Envelopes.py’'and file 3, results processing the actual flexibility reactions as described above are calculated, after the implementation and development as elaborated in appendix A.4.

In file 4a up to 4e, the results are visualized in the networkX graphs.

The most important code snippets are specifically elaborated on in the Appendix file, with introduction and summaries to what the code does.

The provided code in this Github repository have been adjusted and anonymized, so that no vulnerable information is published. Especially with regard to topology name structures, name entries have been adapted.
